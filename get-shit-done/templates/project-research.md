## Category-Specific Guidance

### ecosystem.md

**Purpose:** Map the library/framework landscape for this domain

**Key questions to answer:**
- What are the go-to libraries for this problem?
- Which frameworks are actively maintained?
- What's the "standard stack" experts use?
- What NOT to hand-roll (existing solutions exist)?

**Structure emphasis:**
- Compare 2-4 main options
- Clear "use X when..." guidance
- Version currency (is it maintained?)
- Integration considerations

### architecture.md

**Purpose:** Document standard project structure and patterns

**Key questions to answer:**
- How do experts organize code for this domain?
- What patterns prevent common problems?
- What component boundaries make sense?
- How does data flow in typical implementations?

**Structure emphasis:**
- Directory structure recommendations
- Component organization patterns
- State management approaches
- Integration patterns with related systems

### pitfalls.md

**Purpose:** Catalog what NOT to do and why

**Key questions to answer:**
- What mistakes do beginners commonly make?
- What causes performance problems?
- What architectural choices cause regret?
- What seems like a good idea but isn't?

**Structure emphasis:**
- Clear problem → consequence → solution
- Real examples of failures
- Detection (how to know if you're doing this)
- Prevention (how to avoid)

### standards.md

**Purpose:** Document best practices and quality expectations

**Key questions to answer:**
- What does "production quality" mean for this domain?
- What testing approaches work?
- What performance benchmarks matter?
- What accessibility/security considerations apply?

**Structure emphasis:**
- Measurable quality criteria
- Testing strategies that work
- Performance targets
- Common standards/conventions

<difference_from_phase_research>
## How This Differs from Phase-Level Research

**project-research.md (this template):**
- Written BEFORE roadmap exists
- Informs phase structure and scope
- Ecosystem-level landscape view
- Answers "what tools/patterns should we use?"

**research.md (phase-level):**
- Written AFTER roadmap exists
- Informs specific phase implementation
- Implementation-level detail
- Answers "how do we implement this phase?"

Project research is strategic (shapes the roadmap).
Phase research is tactical (shapes the implementation).

<quality_bar>
## Quality Expectations

A well-written research file:
- Has specific, actionable recommendations (not "it depends")
- Cites sources with confidence levels
- Distinguishes verified facts from educated guesses
- Surfaces open questions honestly
- Can be read in 2-3 minutes and inform a decision

**Avoid:**
- Generic advice that applies to anything
- Recommendations without reasoning
- Outdated information (pre-2024 unless fundamental)
- Confidence without verification
